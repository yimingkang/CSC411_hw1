function [y] = logistic_predict(weights, data)
%    Compute the probabilities predicted by the logistic classifier.
%
%    Note: N is the number of examples and 
%          M is the number of features per example.
%
%    Inputs:
%        weights:    (M+1) x 1 vector of weights, where the last element
%                    corresponds to the bias (intercepts).
%        data:       N x M data matrix where each row corresponds 
%                    to one data point.
%    Outputs:
%        y:          :N x 1 vector of probabilities. This is the output of the classifier.
